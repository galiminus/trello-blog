## Use Trello as your blog backend

- Clone this repository.
- Install all the dependencies with `bundle install`.
- Run the Middleman demo server with `middleman`.
- Create a new Trello board.
- In `source/initializers/config.coffee` set both the API key and your board ID.
- Every column is now a category and every card is a blog post, that's all.
